# RigidFoilUDFGenerator
Python-based oscillating rigid foil simulation package enables novice users to get meaningful computational fluid dynamics results through a streamlined command line interface. 

### Installation
This package can be installed via:

    pip install rgsim

### Prerequisites
The simulation itself is ran through the ANSYS Workbench software package and therefore relies on the successful installation of ANSYS and its dependencies. Some of the dependencies include:
  1. This package was developed using Windows, use with caution when working on other systems
  2. ANSYS 
  3. Visual Studio
  
### Warnings and Limitations
It not recommended to run the Rigid Foil Simulator package without prior working knowledge of how computational fluid dynamics is performed. Output results should be analyzed with discretion before being used to expand and inform on scientific understanding.

### Usage
